Variables is a container where we can store data in computer memory.

Variable is also called a named memory location...why because suppose a=10 so here we r giving a equal 10, means we 
are giving name to that variable.

Variable is pointing to memory address.

There are few rules for variables listed below:-

1. We can not start variable with digit. like int 1=1bd;(it is invalid).
2.We can not use special character such as *,@,# etc, only we can use _(underscore) and $.
