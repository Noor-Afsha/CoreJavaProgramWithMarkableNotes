1. In interface we can write methods, but it should be without body as shown  below:-
	
	
2.What is implementations?
	
1. Its a keyword to implement an interface.
2. An interface consists of only "Abstract method".
3. A class will implement the  interface and define these abstract method as per the required functionality.
4. Here, Any class can implements multiple inheritance.
5. The interface contains only methods declaration not the implementation...like below:-
6. In java interface does not explicit declare a method as abstract or public like(void play(), void pause(), here we are not using public or abstract to indicate the methods.


NOTE:- While writing a method in interface  no need to give abstract..


	   Constructor will invoke it by default.
	   
	   
	   Here will create one interface called Media and other classess are like(Audio and Vedio) and these classes we are implementing with 
	   the parent class called Media...
	   
	   And later will create one Main class and in that main class will create object of each implemented class and by using 
	   reference variable will call the methods.
	   
	   
************Below is the output:-
	   
	   
main method executed
music is playing
Paused the music
stop the vedio
paused the vedio
