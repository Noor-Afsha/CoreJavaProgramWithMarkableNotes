Final is keyword...access specifier..

1. Variable:- if we are using final keyword in variable...it means variable value will never changes in future:-

example:- final int age=12;

here age value will never changed from 12 to any other values, if we try to change this will get compile time error.

2. Class:- if we are using final with class then we can not inherit class.because it will restricted the inherit properties to
its child class.

3. Constructor:-We can not make final in constructor, because it initialized the object and if we make constructor as final 
then we need to make changes in object.so this is the reason why we can not make the constructor final.

Constructor can not be :-abstract, final and static.

Method: It can be final....and no one can overrride that method.
